# StackedFortress

This is the implementation of [a game idea by squidi](http://www.squidi.net/three/entry.php?id=67). We are planning on creating this in a small group as part of the Game Maker Project at the Department of Informatics of the University Hamburg in 2012/13.

## The team

The core team basically consist of

- Sven-Hendrik 'svenstaro' Haase
- Paul 'opatut' Bienkowski
- Hans Ole Hatzel

but since this is open source, you may be part of it as well! Fork and code!

## The game idea

We pretty much base on squidi's concept of the game, though we have some ideas of our own that we want to bring forward. We will create a prototype first, then play around with it, and see what it brings. There will probably be some documents for collecting ideas in the wiki at some point.

## The technology

The prototype will be written in Lua with Löve2D at first, and so will probably the final game, too. It is really easy to learn and use, and we plan on getting something playable quickly.

## How to build/play

On \*nix systems, you should do fine by installing Löve2D, then running `make` or the commands from the `Makefile` to compile and run the game. No idea how to do this properly on Windows ;) Go try yourself.
